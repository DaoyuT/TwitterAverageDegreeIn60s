# TweeterAverageDegreeIn60s

## Project Description
In general, this is a JAVA program that calculates the average degree of a vertex in a Twitter hashtag graph for the last 60 seconds, and update this each time a new tweet appears.
See details in https://github.com/dytu0316/coding-challenge/blob/master/README.md.

## External Libs
- json-simple-1.1.1.jar<br />
This jar file is used to parse JSON from the inputfile.

## Structures
I have 2 additional directories:
- ./bin
- ./libs<br />
**bin** stores the compiled *.class* files<br />
**libs** stores the external libs<br />
To make these directories work in the tests, I silghtly modified the *run_tests.sh* file. So please use my *run_tests.sh* file instead of the original one.

## How To Run
1. cd to the directory
2. $cd insight_testsuite
3. $./run_tests.sh
